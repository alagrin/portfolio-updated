    "bio": "Welcome to my page! I'm an aspiring software engineer taking big ideas and breaking them down into accessible chunks. My current personal project, working with Node, React, and MongoDB to create an easier way for students to collaborate on projects, and most recently an Android application with my fellow grad students allowed me to really dig deep into Java fundamentals and mobile development. Past work has included being a graduate TA for Fundamentals of Software Engineering, working with a music startup on their mobile app, and getting the local DemocracyLab project/website up and running.",
